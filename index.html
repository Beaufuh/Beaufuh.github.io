    <p>I think we can all agree that one of the worst parts about Christmas is feeling like you have to buy someone a gift but not knowing what they want.</p>
    <p>Well this year, I want to help relieve that stress by being straightforward about what's on my wishlist.</p>
    <p>I wanted to make this process as easy as possible, so I made an amazon wish list that you can view and easily purchase from. I also added some other links that are great gift ideas and things that I'd really love.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">As we get older, we find out that the fun part about Christmas isn't the reciving but rather the giving. And I can't wait to give each of you your Christmas present this year. But just as I have been straightforward with you about what I want. I want you to be straightforward with me about what you want. If you haven't told me yet, or if maybe something new has been added to your list. Please let me know! Just shoot me a <a href="tel:7068143204">text</a> and I'll spread the word with Santa to make it happen.</p>
